The main theme for the event are the dotted clothesm because it was Török Szofi's favorite pattern. In this event I perfomed with Vavrinecz András the follow pieces:

* Händel-Halvorsen: Sarabande 
* Händel-Halvorsen: Passacaglia
* Kodály: Duo for violin & cello, Op. 7

"Babits Mihály: The book of Jonas" was performed by 

* **Báhner Péter** as Babits Mihály
* [](<>)**Gabi Kéner** as Török Sophie
